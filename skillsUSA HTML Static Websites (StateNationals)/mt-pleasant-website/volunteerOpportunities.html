    <h2 class="pt-3">Volunteer Opportunities</h2>

    <p class="pt-2">Volunteers are the lifeblood of the Mt Pleasant Animal Shelter. 
      We welcome volunteers of all ages, but those <b>under 18</b> must volunteer with a family member.</p>
    <p>
      To volunteer, you must attend an orientation session, which are held monthly. You also must complete the Volunteer Application. 
      Complete it and bring with you to orientation.
    </p>  
    <p>
       Orientation should last about 1 hour, then you will set up your first volunteering time with a mentor who is an experienced volunteer to show you the ins and out of everything we do here. After that you will be certified to volunteer on your own.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>You must be 18 to volunteer, or with a parent or guardian at all times to be a volunteer.</li>
      <li>The shelter is open to the volunteers EVERYDAY as the animals need to be cared for EVERYDAY!!</li>
      <li>You may volunteer between the hours of 8-4 daily.</li>
      <li>If you feel uncomfortable with an animal, DO NOT feel obligated to walk, or take it to the play yard, 
        or play room, each and every animal will be given their time to play throughout the day.</li>
      <li>HAVE FUN!</li>
    </ol>
